Breast-Cancer-Detection using Deep Learning

Context
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. 

Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.

A tumor is an abnormal lump or growth of cells. When the cells in the tumor are normal, it is benign. Something just went wrong, and they overgrew and produced a lump. When the cells are abnormal and can grow uncontrollably, they are cancerous cells, and the tumor is malignant.

This program utilizes deep learning to predict if a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
